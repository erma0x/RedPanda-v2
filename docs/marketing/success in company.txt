SUCCESS IN A COMPANY

you have to observe what works and what doesn't work, and it's going to be counter intuitive

fast decision and resetting business model if times changes

belive in it 

ask questions

build failures and think of it about learning, fail wisely

network minds, pull bright minds towards you, diversity can be powerful

give 5 minutes values of your time for a colligue as many as you can
